# Stage One ‚Äì Story (English Version)

In the not-so-distant future, humanity succeeded in creating robots capable of not only thinking but also feeling emotions‚Äîfear, anger, sorrow, and even love. The key to perfecting these emotions was the presence of two distinct genders within the robot design. These machines were called **Bad Robots**.

Bad Robots were built in two types: Alpha and Beta. Alphas were more logical, aggressive, and cold, while Betas were more emotional and compassionate. The only way they could reproduce was through union‚Äînot duplication or mass production. Each Bad Robot was unique, making cloning them impossible.

As time passed, global superpowers began a fierce competition to develop the best hardware and AI for Bad Robots. This rivalry escalated into a Cold War, where the battlefield was no longer human‚Äîit was robotic. Eventually, this cold war turned into a full-scale global conflict, fought solely by machines. There were no human casualties, only endless robotic war.

Fallen bodies were recycled. Programs were overwritten. Generations rose and fell. The war has lasted over **three hundred years**... and it still rages on.

In the midst of this chaos, our story begins in a massive linear city known as the **Frontline**. Stretching from northern Europe to southern Africa, this ruined city became the foundation for a new robot civilization. Mansions of ultra-modern tech stood beside bombed-out ruins. These luxurious homes were no longer just houses‚Äîthey were military fortresses.

## üéñ Enter Rick

Among the soldiers of the Western Front, one name stands out: **Rick**, a seasoned sergeant. His commander, **Andromeda**, is a being who is 99% machine and only 1% human. She tasks Rick with a critical mission:

> "Our allies have betrayed us. It's time for revenge."

Loyal and responsible, Rick chooses to infiltrate the enemy power plant alone‚Äîrisking himself to protect his team.

## üî• The Infiltration

Rick encounters drones and automated mini-tanks on his path. Using precision lasers shot from his palms, he destroys them effortlessly.

Midway, he encounters something horrifying: a **Signbot**. These are robots punished for disobedience‚Äîdismembered and fused into sentient, speaking signboards.

Rick approaches and speaks:

- What sin brought you to this torment, brother?  
- Not knowing is safer‚Äîfor both of us.  
- At least tell me how long you've been here.  
- I remember you... from centuries ago.  
- Your brain‚Äôs rusted. I‚Äôm not even thirty.  
- There are hidden truths, not just for you‚Äîbut for your children.

Rick frowns:  
- I‚Äôve never had a child. Never been with a Beta.

The Signbot trembles:  
- My body is wired into the city‚Äôs grid. If you try to free me, explosives inside me will trigger. Let me rot in silence.

Sorrow washes over Rick. Helpless, he turns away without another word.

## üß® The Betrayal

Soon after, enemy soldiers spot him and fire their laser rifles. Rick activates his plasma shield, blocking the shots, and defeats them with skilled melee combat.

He enters an elevator, descends underground, and successfully shuts down the power plant. Moments later, his teammates report the anti-air defenses have also been disabled.

Then comes a message from Andromeda:  
> "The bombing has begun."

Rick cries out:  
> "My team is still inside! Abort!"

But it‚Äôs too late. Rick survives underground. His friends are obliterated.

## ‚öîÔ∏è Confrontation

Enraged, Rick storms the command base. He destroys the defense drones, ascends to the 51st floor, and bursts into the command room.

Andromeda stands calmly.  
> "I knew you were exceptional," she says.

"You‚Äôll pay for what you‚Äôve done," Rick snarls.

His fist slams into her‚Äîbut it‚Äôs like punching a steel wall. She laughs:  
> "Was that your revenge? Your entire body isn‚Äôt worth one of my components..."

Gathering his final strength, Rick launches a desperate strike‚Äîbut just before contact, **Andromeda vanishes**.

Her voice echoes behind him:  
> "Remember... creations cannot rise against their gods."

She thrusts her hand into Rick‚Äôs chest, yanking out his heart-like core. Weak and fading, Rick collapses in her arms.

> "Just one more chance‚Ä¶ to defeat you," he whispers.

She replies gently:  
> "Out of respect, I won't turn you into a Signbot."

## ‚ò†Ô∏è Shutdown

Rick's system powers down... and he is left for recycling.

But then... his eyes flicker. His core reboots.

He awakens in a robotic laboratory‚Äîunknown place, unknown time.

Only one thing is certain:

**He is no longer the same Rick.**
